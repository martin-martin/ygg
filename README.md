# YGG - revisit crusty files

After setting up your personal database that collects references to all the file(types) you want to revisit,
you just need to run `revisit.py` and it'll open up your personal random file for today!

Check it out, smile, think, work on it, delete it - whatever seems appropriate!

Clean that gunk! :)

Happy new year everyone!
